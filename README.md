# Telecom_churn_case_study
In the telecom industry, customers retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition
Business Problem Overview:
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.
Business Objective:
The dataset contains customer-level information for a span of four consecutive months - June, July, August & September. The months are encoded as 6, 7, 8 and 9, respectively. The business objective is to predict the churn in the last (i.e. the ninth) month using the data (features) from the first three months. To do this task well, understanding the typical customer behaviour during churn will be helpful.
Analysis Process:
The analysis is divided into nine main parts:

Data Sourcing or Data Understanding
Data cleaning and Derived Metrics
Exploratory Data Analysis (Univariate, Bivariate Analysis)
Model Preparation
Train and Test Data Split
Data Normalization
Handling Class Imbalance
Model Building
Residual Analysis of the Train Data
Making Predictions
Model Evaluation
Final Inference
